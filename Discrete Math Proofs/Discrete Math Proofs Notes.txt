-> mathematical proofs and induction 
-> types of proof
	-> direct proof 
		-> proving something directly 
		-> this doesn't require an inductive step 
		-> we already assume the statement is true 
		-> establishing a connection between the hypothesis and conclusion

	-> contrapositive proof 
		-> a statement is proven by showing that it is contrapositive
		-> negation of the conclusions implies the negation of the hypothesis 

	-> proof by contradiction 
		-> assuming the negation of what is to be proven, and then deriving a contradiction to this 
		-> if we have a statement we want to prove, we assume it's not true and then find an example or do algebra to show that this is not the case 

	-> examples of direct proof 
		-> approaches for this
			-> if one statement is true, then the other must be 
				-> we assume it is, and then show this using induction 

			-> proof by contradiction 
				-> negating what we want to prove, and then deriving a contradiction from this 
				-> we assume the opposite and show it leads to an inconsistency 
				-> then therefore the original statement must be true 

		-> examples involving algebra  
			-> proving that for any integer n, if n is even then n^2 is also even 
				-> this is done with algebra 
				-> you can prove this directly 
				-> even numbers (meaning multiples of 2)
	

			-> second example 
				-> proving that the square root of 2 is irrational 
				-> this can be done using proof by contradiction 
				-> if we assume root 2 is rational, then it equals a over b 
				-> a and b are integers with no common factors 
				-> then we square both sides of the equation, which means one is even 
				-> this means both sides are divisible by 4 - so a and b have no common factors 

	-> inductive examples 
		-> proving the sum of the first n numbers is n(n+1)/2 
			-> this can be done by induction 
			-> showing that this works for the case of n=1
			-> then we assume this for k+1 
			-> which holds true by induction 

		-> then proving by strong induction 
			-> strong induction means that instead of n=1 and then induction, we need to prove that the statement works for multiple different base cases (not just one)
			-> then comes the inductive steps 

	-> advanced optics and applications 
		-> recurrence relations 
			-> indiction is usually used for this 
			-> here, the value of a function is defined in terms of previous ones <- e.g the Fibonacci sequence 

		-> combinatorial proofs 
			-> induction is the method which is most commonly used for this 
			-> mathematical objects are counted / arranged according to specific rules 
			-> e.g, for binomial coefficients / partitions 

		-> advanced mathematical structures 
			-> this is for more complex proofs 
			-> groups, rings and fields 
			-> using this to prove properties and theorems 

	-> conclusions 
		-> proofs <- induction, direct proof and proof by contradiction  
		-> these proofs can be used for reasoning / pure maths / computer science
