-> limits 
	-> the value of a function as a certain point approached
	-> in the limit, as x tends to ..., y tends to ...
		-> this is a one sided limit if it is done from one direction 
		-> e.g, if a function jumps at a certain value, then you can take the limits from either side of this

-> limit definition of a derivative 
	-> change in y over change in x
	-> speed is distance over time <- the gradients on these graphs 
		-> average and instantaneous speeds 
	-> calculating the differential at a point, compared to over the entire function 
		-> the rate of change at a specific point 
		-> the definition of a derivative, calculated with limits 

-> the derivative function 
	-> the instantaneous rate of change at a point 
	-> intervals <- dx's 
	-> there is a definition of a derivative, involving limits
	-> the derivative is the slope of a tangent line at a point 
	-> how a curvier function changes at a specific point 
	-> the tangent <- drawing a line relative to this curve 

-> the derivative of a function is another function <- in this example 
	-> an order of magnitude less 
	-> these tangent lines can be plotted
	-> how a function changes at the same point x

-> properties of the derivative function 
	-> the speed is the gradient on the time-distance graph 
	-> the derivative of a derivative can be calculated	
	-> the rate of change of the derivative 
		-> the function could have reached a local or global maximum 
	-> local minima are inflection points <- curvature 
	-> these are the largest / smallest over the entire function 
		-> extrema 
		-> inspecting the derivative of the derivative can tell you if you are at a local minima / maximum etc

-> calculating derivatives 
	-> how to find derivative functions <- through rules 
	-> building blocks and combining rules 
	-> they are linear operators 
		-> you can bring out the constant coefficients 
		-> the sum of two derivatives is the same as the derivative of their sum 
			-> a series of derivatives 
	-> with products 
		-> the product rule 
			-> we want the derivative of v(x)u(x)
			-> v'u+vu'
			-> they are both functions of x 

	-> the derivative of a constant is 0   
	-> changing between two functions 
	-> taking the differential and then using this to calculate the slope of the tangent 

-> more on calculating derivatives
	-> differentiating specific functions 
	-> polynomials
		-> bring the coefficient down and take away one from the power
		-> this is the "power rule"

	-> logs 
		-> the differential of ln is 1/x 
		-> e^x is the same 
		-> sin is cos and cos is -sin 
		-> what a function and its derivative look like 

-> calculating derivatives in Python 
	-> differential calculus 
	-> computing derivatives by hand 
	-> the functions are given to us in array form, rather than by explicit equation 
	-> importing modules 
	-> using list comprehension to create a list of the y values which we want to store
	-> gradient is rate of change of y over x 
	-> the modules are imported for this, and then the change in the x values are recorded 
	-> the results of this can be plotted <- calculate the derivative of a function by hand, and then plotting it with Python

-> review 
	-> differential calculus 
	-> a limit is the value a function approaches to as we move some x value 
	-> the slope of a tangent line at some point 
	-> the rate of change of the gradient for this 
	-> then calculating derivatives for explicit functions 
	-> the results to this can be stored in arrays 

-> limit definition of the derivative exploration 
	-> numerical differentiation in Python 
	-> taking numerical derivatives
	-> writing a differentiation function in Python
	-> the definition of a derivative in limit form 
	-> there are three functions we already have defined for this 
	-> math.log() <- the default base for this function is e 

	-> coding definition for the differential in terms of limits, into a Python function 
		-> putting different numbers in this which we know should work, to test it

	-> these can then be graphed 
		-> limit derivatives 
		-> this function can be applied multiple times, for the second order differential etc
		-> approximating the derivatives of different functions <- e.g a sin or cos 
		-> whole derivative functions
