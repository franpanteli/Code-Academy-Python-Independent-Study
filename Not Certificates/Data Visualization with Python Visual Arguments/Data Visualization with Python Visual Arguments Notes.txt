-> you can type in the name of the variable which stores the dataset, and it will return it
	-> as opposed to using the .head() method, which returns the first 5 lines and n of them if an argument for it is used 
	-> the need to understand the different terms in the dataset for this, depending on the context 
		-> e.g species of tree or forest types, depending on the type of human intervention which they have had 

-> data from multiple different csv files can be loaded, using pd.read_csv('....csv')
-> %matplotlib inline <- to display the plots inside the notebook which they are generated in 
-> modules which are imported for this 

from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
from matplotlib import cm
import pandas as pd

-> plt.bar(avg_heights.family, avg_heights.trunk, width = 0.35, color='tan') <- to make a bar chart
	-> the bars from this are vertical 
	-> two of these lines in the same cell makes a stacked bar chart, with two colours on the same one 
		-> the width of both of these sets of bars can be different, as can their colours 
	-> this requires plt.show()
	-> we can have multiple different bar plots for this, if we set them up by using a matrix of subplots 
		-> e.g, plt.subplot(3,1,1)
		-> in this case, the subplots are bar charts 

fig = 
plt.subplot(3,1,1)
plt.bar(PF_data.genus, PF_data.counts)
plt.xlabel('Primary Forest')
plt.ylim((0,105))
plt.xlim((-3,105))
plt.xticks(ha="left", rotation=-45)
plt.subplot(3,1,2)
plt.bar(SF_data.genus, SF_data.counts) <- these are set here 
plt.xlabel('Secondary Forest')
plt.ylim((0,105))
plt.xlim((-3,105))
plt.xticks(ha="left", rotation=-45)
plt.subplot(3,1,3)
plt.bar(SLF_data.genus, SLF_data.counts)
plt.xlabel('Selectively Logged Forest')
plt.ylim((0,105))
plt.xlim((-3,105))
plt.xticks(ha="left", rotation=-45)
plt.show()

		-> the sizes of these subtitles and their positions can be changed as well, depending on how we want the figure based on this to look 
		-> annotations can then be added to this and numerous modifications can be made, including adding annotations to them for example  
		-> you can also add a larger amount of bars to the chart and make the data more expansive by doing this 
			-> these can be colour coded, according to the different datatypes
